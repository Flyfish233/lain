# Privacy Policy

This app, known as "Lain," only has Internet access permission to download models from Hugging
Face (huggingface.co). The model download feature uses the system-provided `DownloadManager`, which
requires Lain to declare Internet access permission. To use local models only, fork and delete
`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />` .

As an open-source project, Lain not and can not collect any information.
